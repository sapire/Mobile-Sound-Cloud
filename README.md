# Mobile-Sound-Cloud

## Second assignment in course "Mobile App Development"

The app contains a main screen with a search bar for the user to type his/her search query.

![Home screen](https://github.com/sapire/Mobile-Sound-Cloud-App/blob/master/home-screen.jpeg?raw=true)

Once the user clicks one of the search results items, it starts playing that track.
In case the user presses another track - it will start playing it instead of the currently played track.

At the bottom of the main screen,, there should be a button to navigate to the recent queries of the user.
If this button is clicked, it will navigate the application to a screen to view 5 most recent searches.
